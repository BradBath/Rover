#Video of controller

In this very blurry video, I try to showcase the controller. In this video I am typing commands onto the arduino which then send those commands back to unity which parses them and runs them.

I use the following commands:
Move(float speed) to move the rover at a certain speed (defined by speed parameter)
Turn(float deg) to turn the wheels to the defined degrees in the parameter
Stop() to engage brakes on the rover

It's quite hard to see though, since I couldn't get my phone to focus on the arduino screen.
